# Pokemon Laser Defender
Pokemon Laser Defender is a game made in Unity based on the [C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code by Making Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WjsAkoTcF9UQH4=) course in Udemy.

In the course, this game is originally a common laser defender with space ships, lasers and bombs. I gave it a twist by ideating it on a Pokemon world and adding some basic animations.

You can [Play it](https://franfusaro.github.io/pokemon-laser-defender) on GitHub Pages on any desktop browser! Just use the arrows to move and the space bar to fire. Enjoy :)
